# Converge

A wallet which makes interactions with DeFi much easier. \
Interacting with blockchain applications can be complex, requiring users to navigate multiple screens and manually input details. 
This app solves that problem by enabling transactions using simple natural language commands. Instead of clicking through various menus, users can just type commands like:

➡️ Transfer 1 ETH to 0x123 \
➡️ Swap 1 ETH for STRK \
➡️ Swap 1 ETH for STRK and send it to 0x123 

The app intelligently processes these commands, extracts key details, and presents a confirmation modal where users can review and modify the transaction before approving it. 
This ensures a smoother, more intuitive, and safer user experience. 

### Why is this useful?
✅ Easy Onboarding – No need for users to set up wallets manually. Just log in with email, verify, and start transacting.\
✅ Frictionless Transactions – No need to navigate complex menus; users can simply type commands in plain English.\
✅ Better User Experience – Unlike AI agents that might immediately execute a command, this app presents a confirmation modal where users can verify and modify details before proceeding.\
✅ Batch Transactions – Users can execute multiple transactions in a single command, saving time and effort.

### Future Plans
🚀 Integrate More DeFi Apps – Add support for lending, borrowing, bridging, staking, and more. \
💳 Onramp & Offramp Integration – Make it easier for users to buy and cash out crypto directly. \
🗣️ Expand Natural Language Support – Enable more complex interactions using conversational commands.
